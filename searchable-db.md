### --Were Your Medical Test Results Compromised?--

A Rapid Action Battalion unit raided two pharmaceutical distributors in Shyamoli last week and found them selling large quantities of expired drugs and diagnostic reagents. None of the drugs or reagents were stored at their proper temperatures and the warehouses kept no record of where and when they were manufactured. Magistrate Sarwoer Alam fined the distributors, LifeTech and VieTech, a sum of Tk 18 lakh.

Bazarwatch acquired their sales records to check out where these distributors were selling below-standard drugs.  We chose these three reagents – HbA1c ( a blood sugar level test), SdA1c ( a hemoglobin test), and hsCRP ( a test for C-Reactive protein for assessing heart disease risk) – and examined which hospitals were regular customers. The quantity of the pharmaceuticals sold – and the time periods they were sold during – are presented in the visuals below.   
“All tests done with these reagents are compromised because they may have used expired reagents,” said Dr Mohammad Shahjahan, assistant director of the Directorate General of Health, who was present on spot.

It cannot be said for sure if all the numbers represent expired products because the distributors kept no documentation of their shipments – but it can be concluded that the test results are compromised. Officials found only two medium sized refrigerators in the warehouses despite the large volume of temperature sensitive drugs they handle and this gave them adequate reason to believe LifeTech and VieTech have consistently sold expired products.

If you have gotten a hemoglobin, a blood sugar or a C-Reactive protein test done recently, check the table to see whether your hospital is on the list. Check the time period to see if the date of your test falls within it.

If you are working in the hospitals listed, check how much you may have spent on potentially expired products.

One of the largest hospitals in the city, and ironically enough, the hospital run by the law enforcers themselves, Central Police Hospital, was found to be a regular customer of Vietech. The distributor sold them Tk 1,950,00 worth of reagents between February and September.

“We acquired our equipment from Vietech, so unfortunately we have been getting a lot of reagents from them too, to fit the machines,” said  Dr Golam Quraishi, who heads the diagnostics department of the hospital. According to the sales invoices the hospital has used 750 reagents from them.

According to their contract with them, the distributors are supposed to bringing in the drugs via a cold-chain import process, said Quraishi. Vietech delivers the drugs stored under the proper temperatures as well, he said.  “The packaging however is theirs. This is making me wonder whether they simply import in bulk, store under uncontrolled temperatures in their warehouses and then repackage it in cold-chain packaging,” he added.
